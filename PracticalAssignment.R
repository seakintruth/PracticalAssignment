## The model
# The idea is to introduce a binary variable $x_{i, j}$ that is $1$ if student $i$ is matched to event $j$.
# As an objective we will try to satisfy preferences according to their weight. So assigning a student to 
# an event with preference 3 gives 3 points and so forth. 

# `r nrow(filter(matching, weight == 3))` students got their top preference.
# `r nrow(filter(matching, weight == 2))` students were assigned to their second choice and 
# `r nrow(filter(matching, weight == 1))` students got their least preferable event.
# For production, these will not be assigned randomly, but will place preference on the events that
# are closest to the end of the course.
